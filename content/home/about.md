widget: I am a PhD candidate in the Civil and Systems Engineering Department at
  Johns Hopkins University, under the supervision of James K. Guest. My research
  focus on developing optimization algorithms to design light-weight and
  high-performance structures and materials with various manufacturing
  requirements. Topology optimization frameworks and advanced finite element
  models are implemented.  My research interests are in topology optimization
  for additive manufacturing, multi-physics problems, mechanics and design of
  composite materials, multi-material topology optimization, and design and
  optimization of lattice structures.  I am currently looking for a postdoctoral
  position where I can further develop my professional skills and value my
  research passion.
